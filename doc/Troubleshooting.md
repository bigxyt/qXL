### Issue 1 - memory leak while using charts based on RTD data

##### Problem
It was observed that memory usage is constanly growing for Excel Workbooks which contain charts built dynamically based on the data from `RTD` formula. The increase in memory usage depends on the charts types and amount of data they require. 
The issue is caused by the memory leak for Excel charts with external data source. 

##### Solution
Using charts with `RTD` data is generally not recommended. Open again the Workbook to free the memory.

### Issue 2 - no data updates after calling `qRTDClose` and `qRTDOpen`. 

##### Problem
In case of calling `qRTDClose` function the subscription is properly closed and the `RTD` formuls stops updating. However, calling `qRTDOpen` with the same alias again does not result in subsribing for new values. 

##### Solution
Calling `qRTDOpen` with different alias refreshes the connection and results in subscribing for new values. 

### Issue 3 - stop of the display in the Excel after publishing process is stopped

##### Problem
In case of stopping the publishing `q` process to which Excel is subscribed the `RTD` formula values stop updating. Even after restrting the process the subscription is not automatically re-opened, values are not updating. 

##### Solution
Calling `qRTDOpen` with different alias refreshes the connection and results in subscribing for new values. 

### Issue 4 - different display of `qQueryRange` and `qQuery` nested results. 

#####Problem
Nested results (with more than two dimensions) are displayed differently in Excel in `qQuery` and `qQueryResult` formulas.
Whenever we try to display something different than `q` atom in single cell `qQuery` prints `#VALUE` error and `qQueryRange`
leaves the cell blank. 

Please see the example below: 

We query nested list which have atoms on all position except for the first element of the second row where there is another list. 

`qQuery` displays nested result as `#VALUE` error in Excel as can be seen below:

`qQueryRange` displays nested result as empty cell as can be seen below:

##### Solution

To have the same display `qQuery` can be wrappred with `IFERROR` formula as can be seen below:
